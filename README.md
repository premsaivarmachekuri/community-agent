## Features

- **Community manager AI**—routes questions, welcomes members, surfaces unanswered threads, and flags issues to a lead. Powered by [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev)
- **Channel-aware routing**—configurable channel map so the bot knows your workspace layout and where to send people
- **Durable workflows**—every LLM call and tool execution is a checkpoint with automatic retries via [Vercel Workflow](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow)
- **Web search**—Anthropic's native web search tool, scoped to your community's domains via `SEARCH_DOMAINS`. Runs through [AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway)
- **Sandbox execution**—optional `bash`/`bash_batch` tools for running commands in a sandboxed environment via the [Knowledge Agent Template](https://github.com/vercel-labs/knowledge-agent-template) API
- **Native Slack UI**—typing indicators, threaded replies, and DMs. Powered by [Chat SDK](https://chat-sdk.dev)
- **Admin panel**—live dashboard with real-time streaming indicators, ViewTransition animations, activity feed, type filters, text search, inline conversation previews, activity trends, and settings page with channel overview
- **Auth**—Slack OAuth via [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com) restricts the admin panel to workspace members

## Quick start

Try the admin panel without setting up Slack:

1. Import the repo on [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Add a `COMMUNITY_NAME` env var (e.g. `DevHub`)
3. Deploy—the dashboard works immediately with mock data

For the full Slack bot setup, see [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).

## Customization

| What to change  | File                                | Details                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Bot personality | `lib/agent.ts`                      | System prompt and instructions           |
| Channel map     | `lib/channels.ts`                   | Must match your Slack workspace          |
| Welcome message | `lib/welcome.ts`                    | Sent when new members join               |
| Agent tools     | `workflows/agent-workflow/tools.ts` | Add, remove, or modify tools             |
| Auth config     | `lib/auth.ts`                       | Slack OAuth for the admin panel          |

### Knowledge base

This template is designed to work alongside the [Knowledge Agent Template](https://github.com/vercel-labs/knowledge-agent-template). Set `SAVOIR_API_URL` to connect to a deployed Savoir backend, giving the bot `bash` and `bash_batch` tools to search and read your community docs remotely. Without it, the bot still works using web search, channel routing, and the system prompt.
