# Architecture

The app has two halves: a **Slack bot** and an **admin panel**, both in a single Next.js deployment.

## Slack bot flow

```
Slack message → Chat SDK (receive & route) → Vercel Workflow (durable) → AI SDK (think & generate) → Chat SDK (reply to Slack)
```

Three layers work together:

- **[Chat SDK](https://chat-sdk.dev)** — the messaging layer. Receives Slack webhook events, manages conversation threads, stores history in Redis, sends replies, shows typing indicators. It's the bot's "mouth and ears." Supports multiple platforms (Slack, Discord) so the same AI logic can be reused with a different adapter.
- **[AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev)** — the AI layer. Sends prompts to the model (Claude, GPT, etc.), streams responses, handles tool calls. It's the bot's "brain." Doesn't know anything about Slack — just does LLM calls.
- **[Vercel Workflow](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow)** — the durability layer. Wraps AI SDK calls in durable steps with automatic retries and checkpoints. If a long response fails halfway, it picks up where it left off instead of starting over.

## Tools

Tools (`suggest_channel`, `unanswered`, `bash`, `bash_batch`, `web_search`, `flag_to_lead`) run as durable steps inside the workflow. `web_search` wraps Claude's native search tool via a `generateText` sub-call. Less-used tools use Claude's `deferLoading` so only relevant tools are loaded into context. Welcome messages for new members are handled directly in the route (no workflow needed).

## Admin panel

- Server-rendered dashboard built with shadcn/ui, Geist font, light/dark theme
- `cacheComponents` and React Compiler enabled — pages are non-async, maximizing the static shell
- **Live streaming**: client components poll Redis for active streams every 3 seconds. The overview page shows how many conversations the bot is handling, the activity page shows live cards per conversation, and the conversation detail page shows a "Bot is responding..." indicator. When streams end, `startTransition` batches the cleanup with `router.refresh()` so stats and action lists update seamlessly via ViewTransition
- Bot actions and full conversations logged to Upstash Redis (30-day TTL)
- Slack OAuth via Better Auth — only workspace members can sign in
- Falls back to mock data when Redis is not configured — works out of the box

## Key Files

**Customize these:**

> **Workflow constraint:** Files using `'use step'` or `'use workflow'` must live inside the `workflows/` directory for the bundler to process them. Node.js-only packages (like `@slack/web-api`) must be dynamically imported inside step functions — they can't be used at the workflow top level.
