# Full setup (Slack bot + admin panel)

## 1. Create Slack app

Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → **Create New App** → **From a manifest**.

Paste this manifest (replace `your-app.vercel.app` with your deployed URL):

```json
{
  "display_information": {
    "name": "Community Agent",
    "description": "AI-powered community manager",
    "background_color": "#000000"
  },
  "features": {
    "bot_user": {
      "display_name": "Community Agent",
      "always_online": true
    }
  },
  "oauth_config": {
    "scopes": {
      "bot": [
        "app_mentions:read",
        "assistant:write",
        "channels:history",
        "channels:join",
        "channels:read",
        "chat:write",
        "emoji:read",
        "groups:history",
        "im:history",
        "reactions:read",
        "search:read.public",
        "search:read.users",
        "users.profile:read",
        "users:read"
      ]
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "event_subscriptions": {
      "request_url": "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/slack",
      "bot_events": [
        "app_mention",
        "member_joined_channel",
        "message.channels",
        "message.groups",
        "message.im"
      ]
    },
    "org_deploy_enabled": false,
    "socket_mode_enabled": false,
    "token_rotation_enabled": false
  }
}
```

After creating:

1. Go to **App Home** in the left sidebar → enable **Messages Tab** → check **"Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab"**
2. Click **Install App** in the left sidebar → **Install to Workspace** → authorize
3. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`) from OAuth & Permissions
4. Copy the **Signing Secret** from Basic Information (click Show)

> **Tip:** Create a free test workspace at [slack.com/create](https://slack.com/create) to experiment safely. Add channels matching the template defaults (`#help`, `#bugs`, `#introductions`) and install the bot there.

## 2. Configure environment variables

Add these in your Vercel project settings (or `.env.local` for local dev):

| Variable                   | Required  | Description                                                                                                                                        |

## 3. Set up Vercel storage

The app uses two databases. Set both up from the Vercel **Storage** tab—env vars are added to your project automatically.

**Turso (auth sessions):**

1. Go to your Vercel project → **Storage** tab → **Create Database** → **[Turso](https://turso.tech/)**
2. Auto-populates `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` and `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`
3. Create the auth tables—run `npx auth@latest migrate` locally, or use the Turso dashboard SQL console. See the [Better Auth migration docs](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/database#running-migrations) for details.
4. For local dev, no setup needed—defaults to `file:local.db`

**Upstash Redis (bot action logging):**

1. Go to **Storage** tab → **Create Database** → **Upstash Redis**
2. Auto-populates env vars. The app only needs **two of them**:

| Vercel Marketplace variable   | Equivalent `UPSTASH_*` name | Used?                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `KV_REST_API_URL`             | `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`    | **Yes**—set one or the other                             |
| `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`           | `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`  | **Yes**—set one or the other                             |
| `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN` | —                           | No (app needs write access)                              |
| `KV_URL`                      | —                           | No                                                       |
| `REDIS_URL`                   | —                           | No (this is for conversation state, not the admin panel) |

Without Upstash Redis, the admin panel shows mock data—everything else still works.

Pull env vars locally after setup: `vercel link && vercel env pull .env.local`

## 4. Set up Slack OAuth for admin panel

The admin panel uses Slack OAuth—only members of your workspace can sign in. This reuses the same Slack app you created in step 1.

1. Go to your Slack app → **Basic Information** → **App Credentials**
2. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
3. Go to **OAuth & Permissions** → **Redirect URLs** → add `https://<your-production-domain>/api/auth/callback/slack`
4. Find your **Workspace ID** (starts with `T`)—visible in the browser URL when using Slack: `app.slack.com/client/T.../...`
5. Add these env vars to your Vercel project (make sure to include the **Production** environment):
   - `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`—Client ID from step 2
   - `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`—Client Secret from step 2
   - `SLACK_TEAM_ID`—Workspace ID from step 4
   - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`—generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - `BETTER_AUTH_URL`—your production domain URL (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

> **Important:** Use your **production domain**—not a branch deployment URL (e.g. `git-main` variants). Branch URLs are preview deployments and may interfere with OAuth callbacks. Check **Settings → Domains** for the correct URL.
>
> **Local dev:** Add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/slack` as a second redirect URL in the Slack app. Set `BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000` in `.env.local`.

## 5. Configure channels

Edit `lib/channels.ts` to match your Slack workspace. These map to **existing channels**—the bot does not create them.

```ts
export const channels: Record<string, ChannelConfig> = {
  help: {
    name: 'help',
    description: 'Get help with questions and issues',
    topics: ['questions', 'support', 'troubleshooting'],
  },
  introductions: {
    name: 'introductions',
    description: 'New members introduce themselves',
    topics: ['introductions', 'new members'],
    isWelcomeChannel: true,
  },
  // Add your channels here...
};
```

Then **invite the bot** to each channel so it can read messages and post replies:

```
/invite @Community Agent
```

Run this in every channel listed in your config. The bot can't scan for unanswered questions or post welcome messages in channels it hasn't been invited to.

## 6. Deploy

```bash
vercel
```

After deploying, go to your Slack app → **Event Subscriptions** → set the Request URL to `https://<your-production-domain>/api/slack` and verify it shows a green checkmark.

> **Note:** Vercel Deployment Protection may block Slack webhooks and OAuth callbacks. If the bot or auth isn't working, check your protection settings.

## Testing the bot
